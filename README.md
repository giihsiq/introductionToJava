# 📌 Java OOP Studies

## 📖 Description

This repository was created as part of my first studies in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java**. The content is based on courses from **Udemy** (taught by **Nélio Alves**) and the **DevDojo** YouTube channel, focused on fundamental concepts of the Java language and object-oriented development best practices.

Throughout this project, I’ll be storing exercises, examples, and small practical projects related to:

- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  
- Constructors and Methods  
- Object Relationships
